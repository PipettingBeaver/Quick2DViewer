## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-22

Initial public version: a single-file, dependency-free HTML/JS/CSS viewer that
overlays sequence-based predictions (MPI Quick2D) with structure-derived
annotations (pLDDT, RSA, cofactors) for a single target protein.

### Added

- **Views**: heatmap grid (one row per track, per-residue colored cells, pinned
  AA header + residue ruler) and an overlaid graph view (pLDDT/RSA SVG line plots
  over annotation rows, per-model overlays, clickable points).
- **Selection**: drag, additive (Ctrl/Cmd) disjoint selection, row-scope drag,
  type-badge/score-band/residue-class selection, keyboard navigation, and five
  color-coded saved-selection slots with name labels.
- **Sequence search** with curated motif presets (PTMs, localization/trafficking
  signals, binding motifs, compositional stretches) plus regex and case toggles.
- **Conservation scoring** (Shannon entropy / JSD-vs-BLOSUM62 / Wu–Kabat) over
  imported variant FASTA, optional HHpred homolog inclusion, and auto/aligned/
  unaligned alignment modes (Needleman–Wunsch, BLOSUM62).
- **Variant tracks** with per-cell match/mismatch shading against the reference.
- **Homolog tracks** (HHpred) with match-quality coloring, AA-sequence mode, and
  conservation-color mode.
- **Track Control**: per-type and per-track "View as" modes (Glyphs / No letters /
  Bar / AA / Hidden), Config frames, and per-track overrides.
- **Embedded Py3Dmol viewer** with RCSB auto-fetch for PDB-ID homologs,
  selection→structure coloring, and base color schemes.
- **Selection → ChimeraX / PyMOL / VMD command generation** with match-color mode.
- **Persistence & data**: metrics table, options/data/help modals, JSON save-file
  export/import, device-local IndexedDB structure cache, and auto-save.
- **Accessibility**: keyboard navigation, modal focus management, selectable
  annotation color palettes (incl. colourblind-safe), and tooltips.
- **Horizontal accordion zoom** (4–12 px/column) with cursor-anchored Ctrl+wheel.
